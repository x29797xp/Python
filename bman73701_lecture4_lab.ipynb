    "**Object**: In Python, everything is an object. It may seem obvious that a variable (something you have assigned a value to) is an object. It may be less obvious that a function is also an object. You can assign a function, a class, and pretty much anything else we encounter to a variable. They are all objects. You can pass them in to arguments of functions and do a whole host of things.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Class**: A structure for defining a type of object. So, a <code>dict</code> is a class, a <code>list</code> is a class etc. They are useful for grouping together data, and for having variables behave a particular, repeatable way.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Method**: A function that is associated/part of a class. We've seen some methods before, like <code>.append()</code> is a method of the class List.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instance**: An object that is of a particular class. So, any list you have ever made is an instance of the class <code>List</code>. You can use the <code>type()</code> function to find out the class of any object.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Attribute**: Here you can have class attributes and instance attributes. Sometimes they are also called class variables. This is basically assigning and naming different variables, and binding it to an instance or the class itself. Some examples later should clarify this.  "
